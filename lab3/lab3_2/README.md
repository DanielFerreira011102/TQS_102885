# Exercise 2: Cars service

This project involves developing an API for a car information system using Spring Boot. The project structure is based on a class diagram, and the approach used is Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## Key Takeaways
- TDD approach helps in writing reliable and efficient code
- Top-down approach for writing tests (controller -> service -> repository) helps in identifying issues early on
- Mocking dependencies helps in writing focused tests and reducing complexity
- Integration tests are important to verify the entire system's behavior
- H2 Database is a useful dependency for testing persistence
