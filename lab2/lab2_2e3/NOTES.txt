UnnecessaryStubbingException
@MockitoSettings(strictness = Strictness.LENIENT)

The subject under test (SuT) is the AddressResolver class, since it's the class we want to test the behavior of.

The service to mock is the ISimpleHttpClient interface, since it's the interface responsible for making HTTP requests to the remote geocoding service,
and we want to isolate the AddressResolver class from the remote service during testing.
