# TQS
Welcome to the official repository of Daniel Ferreira for TQS (Teste e Qualidade de Software) 2023 class! This repository contains all the Lab activites completed as we followed the course and learned about the main concepts, techniques, and tools related to software testing and quality assurance.

The repository is organized into different sections, each one covering a specific topic or assignment. You can find here code samples, as well as the instructions and guidelines for the assignments and projects.

The main goal of this course is to help us understand the importance of testing and quality in software development. Introducing us to different testing methodologies and tools, and providing practical experience in designing and executing software tests.

Feel free to clone, fork, or download this repository, and use it as a reference for your own projects or assignments. 

You can also contribute to this repository by submitting issues, pull requests, or suggestions for improvement. (I'm probably to lazy to actually read them though)

Thank you for joining this class, and happy testing!
